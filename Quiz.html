        <p>List and briefly describe the six activities of Core Process 6: Complete system tests and deploy the solution, i.e. Deployment activities. 
        1. Perform system and stress tests -- System tests are tests that involve all parts of the system in multiple cycles including period based testing (i.e.  month-end).  Stress testing includes high volumes of transactions and other testing that tests the throughput of the system.
        2. Perform user acceptance tests -- User acceptance tests are an extension of system tests.  They test the entire system across time periods, but use data that is either live data or simulated live data.  Users will also test the system for usability, easy of use, and correctness of all answers.
        3. Convert existing data -- Things like Customer records will need to be transported from the old system to the new system. This can be a complex and time consuming activity.
        4. Build materials and conduct training -- This activity can range from almost non-existent to comprehensive and extensive depending on the complexity of the new system and its variance from the previous system. 
        5. Configure and set up the environment -- This is primarily a technical activity to establish a reliable, solid, optimized production environment.
        6. Deploy the solution -- Actually “turning on” the new system and using it for productive business use.​</p>

        2. Unit test the software -- Unit testing is that testing that tests each class and its methods in a limited or narrow context.  It is usually done by the programmer or programming team.
        3. Identify and build test cases -- In order to test the system at a broader level, such as integration or system test, test cases need to be created. These test cases will simulate a real-world environment with both good and bad data.
        4. Integrate and test components -- This is the highest level testing associated with this core  process. The various components (sets of classes) are combined together and tested to ensure that they can function together.​</p>
