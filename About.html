					<strong>BlazeIT was establised as a gaming company in Queensland, Australia in 2035.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Everything we do at BlazeIT is based on the success of the gaming experience we provide to players. 
					The goal of this company is to make our games as fun as possible and reach as many people as we can. 
					We approach every game development very carefully and seriously and also seek for feedbacks so we can use it to improve the quality of our work. 
					Ideas can come from anywhere. BlazeIT is what it is today because of the voices of our players and of each member of the company. 
					Every voice matters. Every employee is encouraged to speak up, listen and be respectful of other opinions. 
					We hope to connect with other people around the world and experience our games. 						
					We strive to support and grow our gaming community.
